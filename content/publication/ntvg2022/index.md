abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced several waves in which the number of hospital beds occupied by patients with COVID-19 has varied greatly. In December 2022, hospitals were under a tremendous pressure, and were forced to upgrade their capacity to phase 2D (“Code Dark Grey”). This is the last phase prior to phase 3 (“Code Black”), in which we would be unable to treat all patients and would be forced to triage based on medical and non-medical characteristics of the patients. In this brief analysis, we demonstrate that phase 2D is characterized by a relatively short mean period of hospital admission and a higher hospital mortality.
