## Overview


![Get test](opnames_per_dag_kliniek.png) ![IC_opnames](opnames_per_dag_ic.png)




1. The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site
2. The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs. It's a good platform for anyone looking to take control of their data and online identity whilst having the convenience to start off with a **no-code solution (write in Markdown and customize with YAML parameters)** and having **flexibility to later add even deeper personalization with HTML and CSS**
3. You can work with all your favourite tools and apps with hundreds of plugins and integrations to speed up your workflows, interact with your readers, and much more

[![The template is mobile first with a responsive design to ensure that your site looks stunning on every device.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/main/starters/academic/preview.png)](https://wowchemy.com)
